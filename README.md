Settle shared payments with your bros - privately

Pridivide tries to help with settling shared expenses between friends after
those awesome big trips, or between roommates after another month of university
studies.

Pridivide was started out of frustration from apps providing the same
functionality. There is no reason why such an app would need you to make an
account, know your location, your contacts, your call history, your IP, your
operating system version, when you last visited the bathroom ... You get the
point by now. Contrary to those apps, pridivide's only job is to do what you
need it to do, without it spying on you behind your back.
